We expect iPhone revenue to grow double digits year over year, which would be our best iPhone quarter ever. On Mac, keep in mind we expect to face a very difficult compare against the M4 MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, and iMac launches in the year-ago quarter. We expect services revenue to grow at a year-over-year rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2025\n","\n","============================================================\n","TOP ACTIVATING TOKENS (ranked by activation value)\n","============================================================\n"," position    token  activation  is_active\n","       44     that    54.40625       True\n","       64   global    53.96875       True\n","       63      the    53.50000       True\n","       45      the    52.87500       True\n","       49        ,    51.93750       True\n","       52      and    51.31250       True\n","       46   global    41.25000       True\n","       51        ,    39.71875       True\n","       43  assumes    38.53125       True\n","      135     face    36.37500       True\n","      136        a    35.00000       True\n","       22      the    32.81250       True\n","      140  against    31.00000       True\n","      141      the    30.75000       True\n","       47   tariff    28.09375       True\n","\n","============================================================\n","ALL ACTIVE TOKENS\n","============================================================\n"," position          token  activation  is_active\n","        6           into    9.859375       True\n","       10              ,    9.781250       True\n","       21       includes   21.281250       True\n","       22            the   32.812500       True\n","       37            the   20.593750       True\n","       43        assumes   38.531250       True\n","       44           that   54.406250       True\n","       45            the   52.875000       True\n","       46         global   41.250000       True\n","       47         tariff   28.093750       True\n","       48          rates    9.203125       True\n","       49              ,   51.937500       True\n","       50       policies   13.742188       True\n","       51              ,   39.718750       True\n","       52            and   51.312500       True\n","       53    application   16.781250       True\n","       62            and   22.781250       True\n","       63            the   53.500000       True\n","       64         global   53.968750       True\n","       65  macroeconomic   19.468750       True\n","       74         expect   12.546875       True\n","      131           mind   23.781250       True\n","      132             we   27.312500       True\n","      133         expect   19.843750       True\n","      134             to   11.648438       True\n","      135           face   36.375000       True\n","      136              a   35.000000       True\n","      137           very   25.875000       True\n","      138      difficult   17.625000       True\n","      139        compare   13.750000       True\n","      140        against   31.000000       True\n","      141            the   30.750000       True\n","      186              2    9.804688       True\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Show highlighted text with activation values\n","print(\"=\" * 60)\n","print(\"HIGHLIGHTED TEXT (tokens with activations > 0)\")\n","print(\"=\" * 60)\n","full_df = parse_activation_results(test_feature_activation(config, input_text))\n","highlighted = highlight_text_by_activation(input_text, full_df, threshold=0)\n","print(highlighted)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"8exgTgmjScGG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769046298267,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":2359,"user":{"displayName":"Rice Wang","userId":"08982185113472774209"}},"outputId":"07789789-780c-4199-c3da-de3ca1db25b2"},"execution_count":47,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["============================================================\n","HIGHLIGHTED TEXT (tokens with activations > 0)\n","============================================================\n","<bos>\n","As we move ahead[ into](9.86) the December quarter[,](9.78) I'd like to review our outlook, which[ includes](21.28)[ the](32.81) types of forward-looking information Suhasini referred to.
